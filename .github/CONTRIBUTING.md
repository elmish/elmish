### Contributor guidelines

First of all - thanks for taking the time to contribute!

With that in mind, elmish is a young project and as such while we welcome the contributions from non-member there are certain things we'd like to get more right than fast. To make everyone's experience as enjoyable as possible please keep the following things in mind:

* Unless it's a trivial fix, consider opening an issue first to discuss it with the team.
* If you are just looking for something to take on, check the [help wanted](/elmish/elmish/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) labeled items


### Opening an Issue

* Before you do, please check if there's a known work around, existing issue or already a work in progress to address it.
* If you just don't know how to do something consider asking in the gitter, there are always helpful people around.
* Provide as much info as possible - follow the template if it makes sense, attach screenshots or logs if applicable.


### Pull requests

To make it easier to review the changes and get you code into the repo keep the commit history clean:

* [rebase your pulls](https://coderwall.com/p/tnoiug/rebase-by-default-when-doing-git-pull) on the latest from repo
* only push the commits relevant to the PR
* consider [squashing](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history) multiple commits to keep the history clean (you *can* force push to your fork!)

If adding a feature, also consider adding a sample (or link to one).
