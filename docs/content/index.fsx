======================

Elmish implements core abstractions that can be used to build Fable applications following the [“model view update”](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) style of architecture, as made famous by Elm.


The goal of the architecture is to provide a solid UI-independent core to build the rest of the functionality around.
Elm architecture operates using the following concepts, as they translate to Elmish:

* **Model** <br />
  This is a snapshot of your application's state, defined as an immutable data structure.

* **Message** <br />
  This an event representing a change (delta) in the state of your application, defined as a discriminated union.

* **Command** <br />
  This is a carrier of instructions, that when evaluated may produce one or more messages.

* **Init** <br />
  This is a pure function that produces the inital state of your application and, optionally, commands to process.

* **Update** <br />
  This is a pure function that produces a new state of your application given the previous state and, optionally, new commands to process.

* **View** <br />
  This is a pure function that produces a new UI layout/content given the current state, defined as an F# function that uses a renderer (such as React) to declaratively build a UI.

* **Program** <br />
  This is an opaque data structure that combines all of the above plus a `setState` function to produce a view from the model.
  See the [`Program`](program.html) module for more details.


### Installation

```shell
paket add nuget Fable.Elmish
```


Concepts
---------------

### Dispatch loop

![flow](img/flow.svg)

Once started, Program runs a dispatch loop, producing a new Model given the current state and an input Message.

See the [basics example](basics.html) for details.



### Parent-child composition and user interaction

Parent-child hierarchy is made explicit by wrapping model and message types of the child with those of the parent.

![flow](img/parent-child.svg)

1. User clicks on the increase button
2. `Widget.view` dispatches an `Increase` message
3. `Main.view` has augemented the `dispatch` so the message becomes `WidgetMsg Increase` as it is sent along to `program`
4. `program` calls `Main.update` with this message and `mainModel`
5. As the message was tagged with `WidgetMsg`, `Main.update` delegates the update to `Widget.update`, sending along the way the `widgetModel` part of `mainModel`
6. `Widget.update` modifies the model according to the given message, in this case `Increase`, and returns the modified `widgetModel` plus a command
7. `Main.update` returns the updated `mainModel` to `program`
8. `program` then renders the view again passing the updated `mainModel`

See the [example](parent-child.html) for details.



### Tasks and side-effects

Tasks such as reading a database or making a Web API call are performed using `async` and `promise` blocks or just plain functions.
These operations may return immediately but complete (or fail) at some later time.
To feed the results back into the dispatch loop, instead of executing the operations directly, we instruct Elmish to do it for us by wrapping the instruction in a command.


### Commands

Commands are carriers of instructions, which you issue from the `init` and `update` functions.
Once evaluated, a command may produce one or more new messages, mapping success or failure as instructed ahead of time. 
As with any message dispatch, in the case of Parent-Child composition, child commands need to be mapped to the parent's type: 

![cmd](img/commands.svg)

1. `Program` calls the `Main.update` with a message
2. `Main.update` does its own update and/or delegates to `Child.update`
3. `Child.update` does its own update and/or delegates to `GrandChild.update`
4. `GrandChild.update` returns with its model and `Cmd` (of GrandChild message type)
5. `Child.update` processes GrandChild's model and maps its `Cmd` into `Cmd` of Child's message type and batches it with its own `Cmd`, if any
6. `Main.update` processes Child's model and maps its `Cmd` into `Cmd` of Main's message type and batches it with its own `Cmd`, if any

Here we collect commands from three different levels. At the end we send all these commands to our `Program` instance to run.

See the [`Cmd`](cmd.html) module for ways to construct, map and batch commands.


### Subscriptions

Most of the messages (changes in the state) will originate within your code, but some will come from the outside, for example from a timer or a websocket.
These sources can be tapped into with subscriptions, defined as F# functions that can dispatch new messages as they happen. 

See the [subscriptions example](subscriptions.html) for details.


### View

The core is independent of any particular technolgy, instead relying on a renderer library to implement `setState` in any way seen fit.
In fact, an Elmish app can run entirely without a UI!

At the moment, there are two UI technologies for which rendering has been implemented: React and React Native.

For details please see [elmish-react](https://elmish.github.io/react).


### Interacting with a browser

Larger Elmish applications for the browser may benefit from advanced features like routing and explicit navigation control.

For information about these features please see [elmish-browser](https://elmish.github.io/browser).


### Observing the state changes

Every message going through the dispatch loop can be traced, along with the current state of the app.
Just augument the program instance with a trace function:

*)
open Elmish

Program.mkSimple init update view
|> Program.withConsoleTrace
|> Program.run


(**

And start seeing the state and messages as updates happen in the browser developer console.

For more advanced debugging capabilities please see [elmish-debugger](https://elmish.github.io/debugger).
